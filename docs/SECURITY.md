# Security Notes

Milestone 0 is mock-only, but the schema and domain follow server-authoritative rules:

- prediction writes must be rejected after deadline or lock;
- scoring rules become immutable after lock;
- members can only see other participants' predictions after league lock;
- official results, scoring events, and leaderboard snapshots are not client-writable in the target architecture;
- provider payloads and secrets are not exposed to the mobile client.

The initial migration enables RLS and adds representative read policies plus trigger guards. Full policy coverage and integration tests are Milestone 1 work.
